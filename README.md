## Motivation

The majority of my life I have been a student, and I have always felt that school was challenging. Not simply in the sense of not understanding concepts being taught, but rather in finding an optimal study method and scheduling my time efficiently. 

Having been through the first year of university, we soon became overwhelmed with the workload and also became disorganised with our study schedule and plans. This further affirmed my view that there needed to be a platform to help students like us plan their day and make studying more productive so that they are able to focus on what is important. Understanding what was being taught. 

With various platforms available to help us manage our time, ranging from notion, nusmods, personal planners and pomodoro timers, we felt the need for an integrated system that can do all that. 

As such, we came up with the idea, Study.io, an integrated platform where students are able to plan their time, organise their notes and tasks. There will also be various productivity features such as a pomodoro timer with the web app to facilitate study sessions.


## Aim

Our goal for this project is to improve productivity and to cultivate good study habits in students. Ideally, users of our application should be able to utilise our core features to better plan their day and keep their tasks organised. Therefore, we came up with this all-in-one workspace progressive web application where students can plan their tasks, take notes, set reminders and plan their timetable. An app for students, by students.
